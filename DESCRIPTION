Description: Create plots that combine a phylogeny and frequency dynamics. 
    Phylogenetic input can be a generic adjacency matrix or a tree of class "phylo". 
    Inspired by similar plots in publications of the labs of RE Lenski and JE Barrick. 
    Named for HJ Muller (who popularised such plots) and H Wickham (whose code this package exploits).
